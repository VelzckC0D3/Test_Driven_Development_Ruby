## Installation

To use the Fizz Buzz class in your Ruby project, you need to include the `fizz_buzz.rb` file in your codebase.

1. Clone the repository or download the `fizz_buzz.rb` and `tests.rb` files.
2. Copy the `fizz_buzz.rb` and `tests.rb` files into your project directory.

## Usage

After including the `fizz_buzz.rb` file in your project, you can create an instance of the FizzBuzz class and call its methods as needed. Here's an example:

```ruby
# Create an instance of the FizzBuzz class
fizz_buzz = FizzBuzz.new

# Calculate the factorial of a number
factorial_result = fizz_buzz.factorial(5) # Returns 120

# Reverse a string
reversed_word = fizz_buzz.reverse("hello") # Returns "olleh"

# Play the FizzBuzz game
fizzbuzz_result = fizz_buzz.fizzbuzz(15) # Returns "fizzbuzz"
```

## Methods

### factorial

The `factorial` method calculates the factorial of a given number.

#### Parameters

- `number` (Integer): The number for which the factorial needs to be calculated.

#### Returns

- The factorial of the given number.

#### Example

```ruby
fizz_buzz = FizzBuzz.new
factorial_result = fizz_buzz.factorial(5) # Returns 120
```

### reverse

The `reverse` method reverses a given string.

#### Parameters

- `word` (String): The word to be reversed.

#### Returns

- The reversed version of the given word.

#### Example

```ruby
fizz_buzz = FizzBuzz.new
reversed_word = fizz_buzz.reverse("hello") # Returns "olleh"
```

### fizzbuzz

The `fizzbuzz` method applies the FizzBuzz game logic to a given number.

#### Parameters

- `number` (Integer): The number to be processed.

#### Returns

- A string based on the FizzBuzz rules:
  - If the number is divisible by 3, returns "fizz".
  - If the number is divisible by 5, returns "buzz".
  - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, returns "fizzbuzz".
  - For any other case, returns the number as a string.

#### Example

```ruby
fizz_buzz = FizzBuzz.new
fizzbuzz_result = fizz_buzz.fizzbuzz(15) # Returns "fizzbuzz"
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests for the Fizz Buzz class, make sure you have the `rspec` gem installed. If you don't have it installed, you can install it by running:

```
gem install rspec
```

Once `rspec` is installed, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```
rspec tests.rb
```

This will execute the test suite

 and show the results.
